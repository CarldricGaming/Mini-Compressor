  * **A:** Yes, it's automatic when you check the option to create a self-extracting archive (SFX).

* **Q:** Some compressors fail, what should I do?
  * **A:** As panker1992 said, "I'm not responsible for the compressors themselves; I didn't write their code. So I can't be blamed for their defects. I'm not responsible for your data loss. Although I'll check if you send me a picture of the problem."

* **Q:** Why can't I compress with DisksPan combined with Masked Compression?
  * **A:** You can't perform compression in that manner because many game files or some bytes may be lost during compression.

  * **A:** It's designed to be user-friendly and not too complex.
