# Q & A
* Q: Is there any update for Mini Compressor?
* A: Yes. But I moved to GitHub as what I can do there.

* Q: Can I change Music and Wallpaper?
* A: Yes. Now you can change the Music and Wallpaper from Options in Mini Compressor.

* Q: Is there any self-extraction on Mini Compressor?
* A: Yes. It's automatic when you Checkbox to create SFX.

* Q: Some Compressors fail, What should I do?
* A: as panker1992 said "I'm not responsible for the compressors themselves, I didn't write their code. So I can't be blamed for their Defects. I'm not responsible for your Data loss. Although I'll check if you send me a Picture that problem."

* Q: Why can't I compress with DisksPan combined with Masked Compression?
* A: You can't do compression like that because many files on your game or some bytes will be lost after compression.

* Q: Why does Mini Compressor seem useful and helpful?
* A: Well, I don't know why you're looking at that. It's because the software is so easy to use. And not too hard.
